World 1
----------
1	- Tapping a hexagon turns it in the direction of the arrow.
	- Turning a hexagon turns the laser as well.
	- Rules applied are counted.
	- Winning requires connecting lasers.
	- (Tapping a polygon applies its rule.)																		[1-2]
	- (Tapping a polygon with no rule still adds to the rules applied.)											[3-4]
	- (Winning requires clearing the board.)																	[1-3]

2	- Tapping a polygon applies its rule, denoted by the icon on the polygon.
	- Triangles exist and they turn differently than hexagons do.
	- Polygons can turn clockwise or counterclockwise.
	- Polygons can be flipped horizontally.
	- Winning requires fully connecting polygons in chains.
	- (Tapping a polygon with no rule still adds to the rules applied.)											[3-4]
	- (Winning requires clearing the board.)																	[1-3]

3	- Polygons can be flipped vertically.
	- Triangles flipping vertically work different than hexagons flipping vertically,
		as it gives them access to directions they weren't able to access before.
	- Flipping a polygon horizontally does not affect any lasers shooting vertically.
	- Winning requires clearing the board.
	- Some moves will lock the level in an unwinnable state. Fixing this will require resetting the board.
	- (If destroying polygons allows currently existing polygons to link automatically without extra rule
		applications, these newly formed chains are added to the Longest Chain stat.)							[1-4]

4	- The order of rule applications is important so as to not fall into traps.
	- There are 3 different traps the player can fall into in this level.
	- If destroying polygons allows currently existing polygons to link automatically without extra rule
		applications, these newly formed chains are added to the Longest Chain stat.
	- (Tapping a polygon with no rule still adds to the rules applied.)											[3-4]

----------
World 2
----------
1	- Connections between two polygons must be of the same color.
	- (Crossing lasers of different colors turns them into dotted black lines.)									[2-3]

2	- Some puzzles are easier than you'd think.
	- Focus on figuring out the rotation of one polygon first. After that, the rest fall into place.

3	- Crossing lasers of different colors turns them into dotted black lines.
	- Sometimes, you need to move lasers out of the way to allow another laser to pass without
		creating a connection by mistake.
	- Lasers hitting other lasers at a non-180-degree angle do not count as connections.
	- (Tapping a polygon with no rule still adds to the rules applied.)											[3-4]

4	- More colors means more limitations on the amount of states the board can have.

5	- Sometimes it's best to start with what is *not* possible rather than what *is*.

6	- Some polygons -- in this case, the triangles -- are distracting and only exist to trap you.
	- Any unplanned move can result in falling into a trap.
	- Finding a solution isn't too hard. Finding an optimal solution is difficult.

----------
World 3
----------
1	- Rule connectors...
		- Can make it hard to connect two polygons.
		- Can connect rotations to flips and vice versa.
		- Stop mattering when there is only one polygon remaining in a rule-connected set.
		- Can land you into traps.
		- Count as only 1 rule application towards the score.

2	- Pressing a polygon with multiple rule-connections applies to all the rule connections.
		- This does not chain through all rule connections along the connected polygons
	- Deleting a connection may ruin the syncronization of another connection									

3	- A rule-connected rotating triangles and flipping polygon will desynchronize

4	- Tapping a polygon with no rule still adds to the rules applied.
	- A rule-connected polygon with no rule can act as a method of bypassing other rule connectors,
		allowing you to unsync rule-connected polygons.

5	- Sometimes multiple desyncing methods are available. Not all of them are equal.

6	- When rule connections abound, the best way to clear up the confusion is by focusing on certain polygons and setting a goal for synchronization/desynchronization.

7	- You need to think ahead
	- Consider first, what the solution should look like. Which lasers should be connected where. Only then, ask yourself what to desynchronize/synchronize
	- Just because polygons are rule connected, doesn't mean they need to be connected by lasers.
	- Think about which rule connections you want to apply rather than which polygons you want to spin.

8	- Use everything you have learned.
	- Good luck.
